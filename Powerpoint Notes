Background - Huntington's Disease:
  Huntington’s Disease: a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the breakdown of nerve cells in the brain. 
  Caused by an unstable trinucleotide repeat in the huntingtin gene, thus translating to a polyglutamine repeat in the protein product.
  Large locus and spans 180 kb and consists of 67 exons.
  Humans express the huntingtin gene for normal development.
  Individuals with Huntington’s disease, display two copies of the huntingtin gene with two different polyadenylated forms.
Background - GWAS
  Observational study of a whole genome set of genetic variants
  Views different individuals to see if any variant is associated with trait
